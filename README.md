# Drums808
iOS 808 drum machine app with simple sequencing options

I had an idea to make a drum sequencing app and what better than the legendary 808! With this app, the user can trigger drum samples in realtime and also make use of basic sequencing buttons.

TR808 samples were sourced from http://smd-records.com/tr808/?page_id=14 [Accessed 18th October 2016]
with many thanks to Michael Fischer of Technopolis for recording these samples and making them freely available
